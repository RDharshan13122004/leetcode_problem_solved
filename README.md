# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems**, written mainly in **Python**.  
I created this repo to track my progress, improve my problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each problem is organized with:
- **Problem Name & Number** (e.g., `151. Reverse Words in a String`)
- **Solution Code**
- **Explanation (Approach, Complexity)**
- **Example Runs**

## 🚀 How I Approach Problems
1. Understand the problem statement & constraints.  
2. Solve manually with simple test cases.  
3. Write a brute-force solution.  
4. Optimize for time & space.  
5. Add detailed explanation & complexity analysis.
